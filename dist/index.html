          <h5>
            Our Planet's Air is an interactive map visualising the different air
            pollutants in major cities using data from the
            <a href="https://aqicn.org/here/">World Air Quality Index</a>.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            The AQI rating of each city is represented by a red circle varying
            in size based on the rating.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            Please be patient as the data can take up to a few minutes to load.
            This message will close when the data is loaded.

          <h2>The pollutants in our air</h2>
          <h5>
            <div class="ptitle" id="po3">O3(Ozone)</div>
            - Ground-level ozone, is “bad” because it can trigger a variety of
            health problems, particularly for children, the elderly, and people
            of all ages who have lung diseases such as asthma.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            <div class="ptitle" id="pco">CO(Carbon Monoxide)</div>
            - Breathing air with a high concentration of CO reduces the amount
            of oxygen that can be transported in the blood stream to critical
            organs like the heart and brain. At very high levels, which are
            possible indoors or in other enclosed environments, CO can cause
            dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death. Very high levels of
            CO are not likely to occur outdoors. However, when CO levels are
            elevated outdoors, they can be of particular concern for people with
            some types of heart disease.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            <div class="ptitle" id="pso2">SO2(Sulfur Dioxide)</div>
            - Short-term exposures to SO2 can harm the human respiratory system
            and make breathing difficult. People with asthma, particularly
            children, are sensitive to these effects of SO2. SO2 emissions that
            lead to high concentrations of SO2 in the air generally also lead to
            the formation of other sulfur oxides (SOx). SOx can react with other
            compounds in the atmosphere to form small particles. These particles
            contribute to particulate matter (PM) pollution.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            <div class="ptitle" id="pno2">NO2(Nitrogen Dioxide)</div>
            - Breathing air with a high concentration of NO2 can irritate
            airways in the human respiratory system. Such exposures over short
            periods can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma,
            leading to respiratory symptoms (such as coughing, wheezing or
            difficulty breathing), hospital admissions and visits to emergency
            rooms.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            <div class="ptitle" id="ppm">
              PM10/PM2.5(Particulate Matter)
            </div>
            - Particulate matter contains microscopic solids or liquid droplets
            that are so small that they can be inhaled and cause serious health
            problems. Some particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter can
            get deep into your lungs and some may even get into your
            bloodstream. Of these, particles less than 2.5 micrometers in
            diameter, also known as fine particles or PM2.5, pose the greatest
            risk to health.
